# VR-Interaction-Framework-v1
VR grabbing/moving interaction framework in Unity

Still very work-in-progress.
You need to import the SteamVR plugin off the asset store for this to work, I did not include that in the repo.

Obviously run SteamVR before you attempt to play.

Features that work so far:

- Single hand grabs
- Two handed grabs
- Easing from two-handed into single-handed grabs. (Currently breaks lengthwise rotation on the anvil!)
- Basic haptics (grabbable touch, grab 'stretch').
- Some visual indicators of hand positions and attachpoints.
